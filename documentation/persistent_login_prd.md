# Product Requirements Document: Persistent Login

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for implementing a persistent login feature (often referred to as "Remember Me") in the Task Management System. This feature aims to improve user experience by allowing users to remain logged in across browser sessions on the same device until they explicitly log out.

## 2. Goals
- Enhance user convenience by reducing the need for frequent logins.
- Maintain a secure authentication system.
- Ensure the feature is intuitive and easy for users to understand.

## 3. Target Users
All users of the Task Management System.

## 4. User Stories
- **As a user, I want to stay logged in to the application when I close and reopen my browser on my trusted device, so that I don't have to enter my credentials every time.**
- **As a user, I want to be able to explicitly log out of the application, which should clear my persistent session, so that I can ensure my account is not accessible on a shared device.**
- **As a user, I expect my session to eventually expire after a long period of inactivity or a pre-defined maximum duration for security reasons, even if I am "remembered".** (This is a common security practice, to be discussed further in EDD)

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1. Core Functionality
- **FR1: Session Persistence:** If a user successfully authenticates, their login session should persist across browser restarts on the same device and browser profile.
- **FR2: Explicit Logout:** The existing "Logout" button must terminate the persistent session, requiring the user to log in again on their next visit.
- **FR3: No UI Change for Login:** The login process itself will not change. The persistence will be an automatic behavior upon successful authentication with Google OAuth or Auth0.
- **FR4: Session Token Management:** A secure mechanism (e.g., a long-lived refresh token or a persistent session cookie) will be used to maintain the session.

### 5.2. Security Considerations
- **FR5: Secure Token Storage:** Persistent session tokens must be stored securely (e.g., HTTP-only, secure cookies).
- **FR6: Token Expiration:** Persistent tokens should have a reasonable expiration period (e.g., 30 days, to be defined in EDD) to limit the window of opportunity for misuse if a token is compromised.
- **FR7: Protection Against Common Attacks:** The implementation should consider and mitigate common web security vulnerabilities related to session management (e.g., CSRF, XSS, session fixation).

### 5.3. Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR1: Performance:** The persistent login mechanism should not introduce noticeable performance degradation.
- **NFR2: Reliability:** The feature should work reliably across supported browsers.

## 6. Out of Scope
- A visible "Remember Me" checkbox on the login page (persistence will be default behavior).
- User-configurable session duration settings.
- Detecting and logging out from other devices (i.e., "log out all other sessions" functionality).

## 7. Success Metrics
- Reduction in the frequency of user logins (can be indirectly measured if analytics are in place).
- Positive user feedback regarding convenience.
- No increase in security incidents related to session hijacking.

## 8. Assumptions
- Users understand the implications of staying logged in on a trusted device.
 - The current authentication integration (Google OAuth or Auth0) can be extended to support or manage longer-lived session identifiers or refresh tokens.
